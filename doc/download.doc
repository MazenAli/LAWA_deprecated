Installation of LAWA
====================

..link: __download lawa__ -> http://sf.net/projects/lawa/files

At the moment LAWA is distibuted as tarball, which can be downloaded from
the project-site at sourceforge (download lawa).

LAWA is currently bundled with a slightly modified version of FLENS. In the
long term the minor modifications will be integrated into FLENS so that the
standard version of FLENS will match the LAWA requirements. For the moment 
a suitable FLENS comes directly with LAWA. 

The installation of FLENS and LAWA on a Unix-like system (the only ones we give
installation support for) takes the following steps:

==LIST:BEGIN==
-> Download and extract the tarball from the sourceforge-site. This will result
   in two folders in the current directory:
==CODE:BEGIN==
  FLENS-lite
  LAWA-lite
==CODE:END==
-> You have to set two environment-variables pointing to the two project roots:
==CODE:BEGIN==
  export FLENS_HOME=/path/to/the/flens/installation
  export LAWA_HOME=/path/to/the/lawa/installation
==CODE:END==
Probably you should place these two lines in one of [.bashrc] or [.profile]
depending on your system to have the variables set automatically.
==LIST:END==
